# Mushrooms:To Eat or Not To Eat
##Using machine learning algorithms to classify whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous based on the different features of the mushroom.

##Mushroom Classification
Wild mushrooms are commonly gathered to be used for things such as cooking. When digesting these mushrooms could be a matter of life or death, we want an algorithm that can quickly classify whether those wild mushrooms are poisonous or edible.

##Data
For this project, I used data from UCI Machine Learning. 
Dua, D. and Graff, C. (2019). UCI Machine Learning Repository [http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml]. Irvine, CA: University of California, School of Information and Computer Science.
This dataset is balanced and after exploration, we see that spore print color has a high significance in classfiying mushrooms.
